# Complete Model Selection and Cancel Job Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### âœ… Issue 1: Model Selection Not Persisting - FIXED

**Root Cause**: Multiple LLM service instances were being created:
- IndexingService created its own LLM instance: `self.llm_service = LLMService()`
- Each service had its own instance instead of sharing a singleton
- When model was updated via API, only new instances got the change

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Implemented Singleton Pattern** in `LLMService`:
   ```python
   class LLMService:
       _instance = None
       _initialized = False
       
       def __new__(cls):
           if cls._instance is None:
               cls._instance = super(LLMService, cls).__new__(cls)
           return cls._instance
   ```

2. **Dynamic Model Property** (already implemented):
   ```python
   @property
   def model(self):
       return settings.OLLAMA_MODEL
   ```

**Result**: All services now use the same LLM instance, and model changes take effect immediately.

### âœ… Issue 2: Cancel Job Not Working Properly - FIXED

**Root Cause**: Cancel only changed job status but didn't interrupt ongoing LLM operations:
- LLM calls were running in `asyncio.to_thread()` 
- No mechanism to cancel in-progress analysis
- Video analysis continued even after "cancel" was clicked

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Added Cancellation Support to LLMService**:
   ```python
   def __init__(self):
       self._cancelled_jobs = set()
   
   def cancel_job(self, job_id: str):
       self._cancelled_jobs.add(job_id)
   
   def is_job_cancelled(self, job_id: str) -> bool:
       return job_id in self._cancelled_jobs
   ```

2. **Enhanced Video Analysis with Cancellation Checks**:
   ```python
   async def analyze_video(self, ..., job_id: Optional[str] = None):
       for i, frame_info in enumerate(frame_data):
           if job_id and self.is_job_cancelled(job_id):
               logger.info(f"ðŸ›‘ Video analysis cancelled for job {job_id}")
               break
   ```

3. **Updated Indexing Service to Cancel LLM Jobs**:
   ```python
   async def control_indexing(self, action: str, job_id: Optional[str] = None):
       if action == "cancel" or action == "stop":
           self.current_job["status"] = IndexingStatus.CANCELLED
           self.llm_service.cancel_job(current_job_id)  # Cancel LLM operations
   ```

4. **Pass Job IDs to Analysis Methods**:
   ```python
   ai_result = await llm_service.analyze_video(
       file_path,
       job_id=self.current_job["job_id"]  # Enable cancellation
   )
   ```

## Files Modified

### 1. `backend/app/services/llm_service.py`
- âœ… Implemented singleton pattern
- âœ… Added cancellation support (`_cancelled_jobs`, `cancel_job()`, `is_job_cancelled()`)
- âœ… Enhanced `analyze_video()` with job_id parameter and cancellation checks
- âœ… Enhanced `_analyze_with_llm()` with cancellation checks

### 2. `backend/app/services/indexing.py`
- âœ… Updated `control_indexing()` to cancel LLM jobs
- âœ… Updated video analysis calls to pass job IDs
- âœ… Updated reindexing calls to pass job IDs

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Model Selection
1. **Immediate Effect**: Changing model in UI takes effect immediately
2. **Singleton Instance**: Only one LLM service instance across the application
3. **Consistent Usage**: All services use the same, current model setting
4. **Log Verification**: `ðŸ¤– Calling Ollama API with model: [selected_model]`

### Cancel Functionality
1. **Quick Response**: Cancel button stops processing within seconds
2. **LLM Interruption**: Ongoing video frame analysis stops immediately
3. **Status Update**: Job status changes to "cancelled"
4. **Log Verification**: 
   - `ðŸ›‘ LLM job [job_id] marked for cancellation`
   - `ðŸ›‘ Video analysis cancelled for job [job_id]`

## Testing Instructions

### Test Model Selection Fix
1. **Start the backend server**
2. **Go to Settings â†’ AI Settings**
3. **Change Vision Model** from current to "huihui_ai/gemma3" (or any available model)
4. **Check server logs** for: `ðŸ¤– Calling Ollama API with model: huihui_ai/gemma3`
5. **Trigger analysis** (upload image or start indexing)
6. **Verify logs show new model** being used

### Test Cancel Functionality Fix
1. **Go to Settings â†’ Indexing**
2. **Add a directory with video files**
3. **Start indexing**
4. **Wait for video analysis to begin** (look for frame analysis logs)
5. **Click Cancel button**
6. **Check logs for cancellation messages**:
   - `ðŸ›‘ LLM job [job_id] marked for cancellation`
   - `ðŸ›‘ Video analysis cancelled for job [job_id]`
7. **Verify processing stops quickly**

### Automated Testing
Run the comprehensive test script:
```bash
python test_comprehensive_fixes.py
```

## Verification Checklist

### âœ… Model Selection
- [ ] Only ONE "LLM service initialized" message in logs after server restart
- [ ] Model changes in UI reflect immediately in API responses
- [ ] Analysis operations use the newly selected model
- [ ] No "gemma3:4b" in logs when "huihui_ai/gemma3" is selected

### âœ… Cancel Functionality
- [ ] Cancel button changes job status to "cancelled"
- [ ] LLM operations stop within 2-3 seconds of cancel
- [ ] Cancellation messages appear in logs
- [ ] No new frame analysis after cancellation
- [ ] UI updates to show cancelled status

## Technical Details

### Singleton Pattern Benefits
- **Memory Efficiency**: Single instance instead of multiple
- **Consistent State**: All services share the same configuration
- **Immediate Updates**: Model changes affect all operations instantly

### Cancellation Mechanism
- **Job-Level Tracking**: Each indexing job has a unique ID
- **Graceful Interruption**: Checks between frames, not mid-analysis
- **Clean State**: Cancelled jobs are tracked and cleaned up
- **User Feedback**: Clear logging for debugging

### Backward Compatibility
- **Optional Parameters**: `job_id` parameter is optional
- **Fallback Behavior**: Works without job IDs (no cancellation)
- **Existing APIs**: No breaking changes to existing endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### If Model Selection Still Not Working
1. **Check for multiple "LLM service initialized" messages** â†’ Singleton not working
2. **Verify API response shows new model** â†’ Settings update issue
3. **Check logs for old model usage** â†’ Instance not using singleton

### If Cancel Still Not Working
1. **Check job status changes to "cancelled"** â†’ Basic cancel mechanism
2. **Look for cancellation log messages** â†’ LLM cancellation integration
3. **Monitor frame analysis logs** â†’ Should stop after cancel
4. **Check UI updates** â†’ Frontend-backend communication

## Performance Impact
- **Minimal Overhead**: Singleton pattern adds negligible overhead
- **Faster Cancellation**: Jobs stop within seconds instead of minutes
- **Memory Savings**: Single LLM instance reduces memory usage
- **Consistent Performance**: All operations use same optimized instance

The fixes address both the root causes and provide robust, testable solutions that improve user experience significantly.
