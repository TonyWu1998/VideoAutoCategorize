# Model Selection Refresh Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Summary

The LLM service model selection was not updating properly when changed through the UI settings. Despite saving the new model "huihui_ai/gemma3-abliterated:4b" in the UI, the system continued using the old model "gemma3:4b" during video analysis operations.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Singleton Pattern Issue**: The LLM service used a singleton pattern that was initialized once with the original model
2. **No Refresh Mechanism**: When the model setting was updated via the API, the existing LLM service singleton continued using the cached configuration
3. **Initialization Skipping**: The singleton's `__init__` method was skipped on subsequent calls, preventing configuration updates

### Key Findings from Logs

- Settings object was global and shared correctly (same object ID: 4365289184)
- Model property was dynamic and returned current settings value
- But the LLM service singleton was initialized once and never refreshed
- API updates were successful but didn't trigger LLM service refresh

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced LLM Service with Refresh Capability

**File**: `backend/app/services/llm_service.py`

Added tracking and refresh mechanisms to the singleton:

```python
def __init__(self):
    # Track the model we were initialized with for refresh detection
    self._initialized_model = settings.OLLAMA_MODEL
    # ... existing initialization code

@classmethod
def refresh_if_model_changed(cls):
    """Check if the model has changed and refresh the singleton if needed."""
    if cls._instance is not None and hasattr(cls._instance, '_initialized_model'):
        current_model = settings.OLLAMA_MODEL
        initialized_model = cls._instance._initialized_model
        
        if current_model != initialized_model:
            logger.info(f"üîÑ Model changed from '{initialized_model}' to '{current_model}' - refreshing LLM service")
            cls._instance._refresh_internal()

def _refresh_internal(self):
    """Internal method to refresh the LLM service configuration."""
    # Update client configuration
    self.client = ollama.Client(host=settings.OLLAMA_BASE_URL)
    self.timeout = settings.OLLAMA_TIMEOUT
    
    # Update the tracked model
    old_model = self._initialized_model
    self._initialized_model = settings.OLLAMA_MODEL
    
    # Test connection with new model
    self._test_connection()
    
    logger.info(f"üîÑ LLM service refreshed: '{old_model}' ‚Üí '{self._initialized_model}'")
```

### 2. API Integration for Automatic Refresh

**File**: `backend/app/api/config_api.py`

Added automatic refresh triggers when model settings are updated:

```python
if config.ollama_model is not None:
    settings.OLLAMA_MODEL = config.ollama_model
    
    # Refresh LLM service if model changed
    try:
        from app.services.llm_service import LLMService
        LLMService.refresh_if_model_changed()
        logger.info("üîÑ LLM service refresh triggered after model update")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to refresh LLM service: {e}")
```

Also added refresh trigger to the reset endpoint for consistency.

## Testing and Verification

### Test Results

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_model_refresh_api.py`) that verifies:

1. ‚úÖ **Available Models API**: Confirms both test models are available
2. ‚úÖ **Model Configuration Update**: API successfully updates model settings
3. ‚úÖ **Configuration Persistence**: Updated model persists in configuration
4. ‚úÖ **Automatic Refresh**: LLM service picks up changes immediately
5. ‚úÖ **Reset Functionality**: Model can be reset to original value

### Server Log Evidence

The fix is confirmed by server logs showing the refresh process:

```
2025-07-07 04:58:11,692 - app.api.config_api - INFO - üîç Updating OLLAMA_MODEL from 'gemma3:4b' to 'huihui_ai/gemma3-abliterated:4b'
2025-07-07 04:58:11,692 - app.services.llm_service - INFO - üîÑ Model changed from 'gemma3:4b' to 'huihui_ai/gemma3-abliterated:4b' - refreshing LLM service
2025-07-07 04:58:11,703 - app.services.llm_service - INFO - üîÑ LLM service refreshed: 'gemma3:4b' ‚Üí 'huihui_ai/gemma3-abliterated:4b'
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Immediate Effect**: Model changes take effect immediately without server restart
2. **Singleton Preservation**: Maintains singleton pattern benefits while adding refresh capability
3. **Automatic Triggering**: Refresh happens automatically when settings are updated via API
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of refresh failures without breaking API calls
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains unchanged

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/app/services/llm_service.py`**:
   - Added `_initialized_model` tracking
   - Added `refresh_if_model_changed()` class method
   - Added `_refresh_internal()` instance method

2. **`backend/app/api/config_api.py`**:
   - Added refresh trigger in `update_llm_config()`
   - Added refresh trigger in `reset_llm_config()`

3. **Test Files Created**:
   - `test_model_refresh_api.py`: Comprehensive API-based testing
   - `test_model_refresh.py`: Internal mechanism testing

## Usage

The fix is completely automatic. When users update the model through the UI:

1. Frontend sends API request to update model
2. Backend updates settings and triggers refresh
3. LLM service immediately picks up new model
4. All subsequent analysis operations use the new model
5. No server restart required

## Verification Commands

To verify the fix is working:

```bash
# Start the server
cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run the test suite
python test_model_refresh_api.py

# Check server logs for refresh messages:
# üîÑ Model changed from X to Y - refreshing LLM service
# üîÑ LLM service refreshed: X ‚Üí Y
```

## Conclusion

The model selection refresh mechanism is now fully functional. Users can change models through the UI and the changes take effect immediately for all subsequent analysis operations, resolving the original issue where the system continued using the old model despite UI updates.
